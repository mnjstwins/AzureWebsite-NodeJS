Azure NodeJS
============

Deploying a sample Node.js application to Windows Azure Websites (PaaS)

Getting Started
---------------

Firstly, create an Azure website using the [portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

Then integrate source control deployment within the Azure Website. I pointed the source control to this github repository.

Browse to your website and enjoy your deployed Node.js application.
